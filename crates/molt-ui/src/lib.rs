//! `molt-ui`: the GUI operator.
//!
//! This crate hosts the multi-stage front of the node — a first-run wizard
//! (create / open / join / restore), a shared completion screen, the main
//! surfaces view, and a settings panel. The settings are real (they persist
//! to the node's `config.toml` and mirror external edits of it); the
//! workspace lifecycles are real — create/open/join/close write to disk.
//!
//! The GUI is a **live-mirror of the engine's shared session**, not a holder of
//! its own state. Every action (navigate, switch language, save settings, finish
//! a wizard) is turned into a [`molt_core::Command`] on the shared
//! [`WalletHandle`]; a background task re-reads the session on each
//! [`molt_core::Event::SessionChanged`] and pushes it back into the Slint
//! properties. An MCP agent issuing the *same* commands drives this *same* state,
//! so the GUI and the MCP operator are co-equal — exactly as for the surfaces.

// The Slint-generated window (AppWindow, the Strings/Theme globals, every
// row struct) lives in its own crate as a compile-time firewall — see
// molt-ui-window's crate docs. The glob keeps this crate's code reading as
// if the module were still injected here.
